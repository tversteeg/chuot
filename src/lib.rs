#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

//! AGPL licensed and opinionated game engine for 2D pixel-art games.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! - Pixel-perfect pixel art rendering with built-in rotsprite rotation shader.
//! - Window creation with independent update and render game loop.
//! - Hot-reloadable assets, seeing your assets update live in the game when you save them is a great boost in productivity for quickly iterating on ideas.
//! - Single-binary, all non-texture assets should be embedded directly, and textures should be diced into a single atlas map embedded in the binary when deploying.
//! - Simple bitmap font drawing.
//! - Dialogue scripting system.
//! - OGG audio playback.
//! - First-class gamepad support.
//! - In game CPU & memory profiler GUI.
//!
//! # Goals
//!
//! - Ergonomic API with a focus on quickly creating small games, especially for game jams.
//! - Reasonable performance, drawing thousands of animated sprites at the same time shouldn't be a problem.
//! - Proper web support, it should be very easy to bundle as WASM for the web.
//!
//! # Non-Goals
//!
//! - An ECS (Entity component system), although an ECS architecture is great for cache locality and performance, I feel that it's overkill for most small games. Nothing is stopping you to add your own on top of this engine if that's what you want though!
//! - 3D, this engine is only for 2D pixel art.
//! - Vector graphics, similar to the above, this engine is focused specifically on pixel art with lower resolutions.
//! - Reinventing the wheel for everything, when there's a proper crate with good support I prefer to use that instead of creating additional maintainer burden.
//! - Support all possible file formats, this bloats the engine.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Using this crate is quite simple, there is a single trait [`PixelGame`] with two required functions, [`PixelGame::update`] and [`PixelGame::render`], that need to be implemented for a game state object.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use chuot::{Context, GameConfig, PixelGame};
//!
//! struct MyGame;
//!
//! impl PixelGame for MyGame {
//!     fn update(&mut self, ctx: Context) {
//!         // ..
//!     }
//!
//!     fn render(&mut self, ctx: Context) {
//!         // ..
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! # fn try_main() -> miette::Result<()> {
//! // In main
//!
//! let game = MyGame;
//!
//! game.run(chuot::load_assets!(), GameConfig::default())?;
//! # Ok(()) }
//! # try_main().unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! ## `embed-assets`
//!
//! Embed all assets into the binary when building.
//!
//! _Must_ be enabled when building for the web.
//! If disabled all assets will be loaded from disk.
//!
//! This will dice all PNG assets into a single tiny optimized PNG atlas.
//! On startup this diced atlas will be efficiently uploaded to the GPU as a single bigger atlas, which will be used for all static sprites.
//!
//! ## `hot-reload-assets`
//!
//! Hot-reload assets from disk when they are saved.
//! Has no effect on the web target.
//! If disabled _all_ assets will be baked into the binary.
//!
//! ## `read-image` (default)
//!
//! Expose read operations on images, if disabled sprites will be uploaded to the GPU and their data will be removed from memory.
//!
//! ## `dialogue` (default)
//!
//! A thin wrapper around [Yarn Spinner](https://www.yarnspinner.dev/).
//! Allows creating hot-reloadable dialogue systems.
//!
//! ## `in-game-profiler`
//!
//! A profiler window overlay, implemented with [puffin_egui](https://docs.rs/puffin_egui/latest/puffin_egui/).
//!
//! Other profiling methods in your game can also be implemented, the [profiling](https://docs.rs/profiling/latest/profiling/) crate is enabled even when this feature flag is disabled.
//!
//! # Install Requirements
//!
//! On Linux you need to install `asound2-dev` for audio and `udev-dev` for gamepads:
//!
//! ```sh
//! sudo apt install libasound2-dev libudev-dev
//! ```
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! This example will show a window with a counter that's incremented when pressing the left mouse button[^left-mouse].
//! The counter is rendered as text[^text] loaded from a font in the top-left corner.
//! When the 'Escape' key is pressed[^escape-key] the game will exit and the window will close.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use chuot::{
//!   PixelGame, Context, GameConfig,
//!   context::{MouseButton, KeyCode},
//!   glamour::Vector2
//! };
//!
//! /// Object holding all game state.
//! struct MyGame {
//!   /// A simple counter we increment by clicking on the screen.
//!   counter: u32,
//! }
//!
//! impl PixelGame for MyGame {
//!   fn update(&mut self, ctx: Context) {
//!     // ^1
//!     // Increment the counter when we press the left mouse button
//!     if ctx.mouse_pressed(MouseButton::Left) {
//!       self.counter += 1;
//!     }
//!
//!     // ^3
//!     // Exit the game if 'Escape' is pressed
//!     if ctx.key_pressed(KeyCode::Escape) {
//!       ctx.exit();
//!     }
//!   }
//!
//!   fn render(&mut self, ctx: Context) {
//!     // ^2
//!     // Display the counter with a font called 'font' automatically loaded from the `assets/` directory
//!     // It will be shown in the top-left corner
//!     ctx.text("font", &format!("Counter: {}", self.counter)).draw();
//!   }
//! }
//!
//! # fn try_main() -> miette::Result<()> {
//! // In main
//!
//! // Initialize the game state
//! let game = MyGame { counter: 0 };
//!
//! // Run the game until exit is requested
//! game.run(chuot::load_assets!(), GameConfig::default().with_title("My Game"))?;
//! # Ok(()) }
//! # try_main().unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! [^left-mouse]: [`Context::mouse_pressed`]
//! [^text]: [`Context::text`]
//! [^escape-key]: [`Context::key_pressed`]
